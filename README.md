## Overview

Awesome Presentations is a template for build tech talks. Idealize for create small documentations and a guided example for a practice presentation.
The main idea is to suit your main presentation and keep a documentation track for your future presentation.

- Where is the code?
> Into the folder example, your can share with your students and classmates any code. For challenges, guided examples and great documentation.

- For who is this repository?
> For anyone who wants to have a save the time for create a simple structure to organize your presentation and share later, and improve open-source.

- What's next?
> We want to improve always, and a good idea for this repository, would be to build a custom slider with pagination as a template for create a great presentation.

## Documentation 

The Awesome Presentation documentation is still in progress.
